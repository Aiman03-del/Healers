# 🔧 Quick Fix Log - Import Path Issues

##  Problem
After reorganizing the folder structure, some components had incorrect relative import paths causing build errors.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **AddToPlaylistModal.jsx**
**Location**: `src/components/features/playlists/AddToPlaylistModal.jsx`

**Before**:
```javascript
import { useAuth } from "../context/AuthContext";
import useAxios from "../hooks/useAxios";
```

**After**:
```javascript
import { useAuth } from "../../../context/AuthContext";
import useAxios from "../../../hooks/useAxios";
```

**Reason**: File is now 3 levels deep (components → features → playlists), so needs `../../../` to reach src root.

### 2. **Empty Component Files**
Found and commented out empty component exports:

-  `Modal.jsx` (empty)
-  `PlaylistModal.jsx` (empty)  
-  `SongCard.jsx` (empty)

**Action**: Commented out exports in barrel files with TODO markers:
```javascript
// export { default as Modal } from './Modal'; // TODO: Implement or remove
```

## 📊 Path Resolution Guide

From different component locations:

```
src/components/common/Component.jsx
└─ import from "../../context/..." (2 levels up)

src/components/layout/Component.jsx  
└─ import from "../../context/..." (2 levels up)

src/components/features/audio/Component.jsx
└─ import from "../../../context/..." (3 levels up)

src/components/features/playlists/Component.jsx
└─ import from "../../../context/..." (3 levels up)
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Dev Server**: 
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Should start without errors at http://localhost:5173

2. **Check for Import Errors**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Should build successfully

3. **Check Linting**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   Should have no errors

## 🎯 Current Status

- All active imports fixed
- Barrel exports updated
- Empty files commented out
- Dev server should be running
- No breaking changes

## 📝 Next Steps

### Optional - Clean Up Empty Files

If these components are not needed, you can delete them:

```bash
# Remove empty component files
rm src/components/common/Modal.jsx
rm src/components/features/playlists/PlaylistModal.jsx
rm src/components/features/songs/SongCard.jsx
```

Then remove the commented lines from barrel exports.

### Or - Implement Them

If you need these components, implement them:

1. **Modal.jsx** - Generic modal wrapper
2. **PlaylistModal.jsx** - Playlist creation/edit modal
3. **SongCard.jsx** - Song display card

## 🚀 Ready to Go!

Your application should now be running without import errors:
- All paths resolved correctly
- Clean barrel exports
- Professional structure maintained
